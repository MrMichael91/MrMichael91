						<p>
							React Native is an open source framework for building
							Android and iOS applications using React and the app
							platform’s native capabiles. With React Native, you use
							JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to
							describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
							components:
							<span class="text_italics"
								>bundles of reusable, nestable code.</span
							>
							You can learn more about React in the next section. But
							first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.

						<p>
							React Native runs on
							<span class="underlined_text">React</span>, a popular open
							source library for building user interfaces with
							JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to
							understand React itself. This section can get you started
							or can serve as a refresher course.
						</p>
						<p>We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
						<p>
							<span class="text_bold">+ components.</span> The rest of
							this introduction to React uses cats in its examples:
							friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe
							to work in.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="text_bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React
							Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements
							inside JavaScript like so:
							<span class="highlighted_text"
								>&#60;Text&#62;Hello, I am your cat!&#60;Text&#62;</span
							>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The React docs have
							<span class="underlined_text"
								>a comprehensive guide to JSX</span
							>you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is
							JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are
							declaring a <span class="highlighted_text">name</span> for
							the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
							<span class="highlighted_text">&#60;Text&#62;</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="text_bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for
							“properties”.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="text_bold">+ state.</span> While you can think
							of props as arguments you use to configure how components
							render, state is like a component’s personal data storage.
							State is useful for handling data that changes over time or
							that comes from user interaction. State gives your
							components memory!
						</p>

								Handling text input
								<span class="main_text_title_chapter">Chapter 4 </span>
							</h1>
						</div>
						<p>
							TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter
							text. It has an
							<span class="text_italics">onChangeText</span> prop that
							takes a function to be called every time the text changed,
							and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be
							called when the text is submitted.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, let's say that as the user types, you're
							translating their words into a different language. In this
							new language, every single word is written the same way:
							&#127829;. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
							translated as "&#127829; &#127829;".
